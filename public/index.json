[{"content":"Executive Summary 14 DEC 25 at approx 1845 local time two confirmed gunmen armed with 1x shotgun and possibly 2x long rifles fired fired on civilian at Archer park at Bondi Beach, Sydney. Reporting indicates at least 10 dead including one of the shooters. Over 15 injured including two police. Has been declared a terrorist attack targeting the Sydney Jewish community. Context At around 1845 local time (0845 Zulu time) at Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia. Two gunmen were recorded shooting from a pedestrian bridge to the north of the Bondi Beach Pavilion. The men were armed with a confirmed shotgun, and PROBABLY two rifles, caliber unknown.\nBoth gunmen were neutralized by police, with video showing one gunmen PROBABLY deceased and the other gunmen LIKELY alive though in a serious condition.\nReporting indicates that at least nine civilians are deceased with 11 reported injured, alongside 2 injured police officers.\nSpeculation online has indicated that the shooting is religiously motivated. This is unconfirmed. Chabad of Bondi did advertise an event at the same time and place as the shooting which is a strong indicator. The gunmen’s location was less than 100m from the event location and less than 50 meters from a filmed location showing mass casualty treatment. Further reporting is required to confirm the motive of the attack.\nIt is ALMOST CERTAIN that Australian police services will conduct an in depth investigation to determine the motive of the attacks. If it is determined to be a religiously motivated attack, there will LIKELY be links between the gunmen and groups backed by Iran or it’s proxies. This would be a strong indicator that Iranian backed groups hold influence within Australia and could LIKELY organize additional attacks against Jewish groups in Australia. Domestic security posture will ALMOST CERTAINLY increase over the Australian holiday season.\nAnalysis was conducted via geolocation of social media videos, online research of local events and interviews/reports by local media outlets. All information is independently gathered, aggregated and assessed.\nProbability Indicators Probability \u0026lt; 10% \u0026lt; 25% \u0026gt; 25% \u0026gt; 50% \u0026gt; 75% \u0026gt; 90% Wording DOUBTFUL UNLIKELY POSSIBLE LIKELY PROBABLE ALMOST CERTAIN ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sitreps/sitrep25dec14-bondishooting/","summary":"14 DEC 25 at approx 1845 local time two confirmed gunmen opened fire at Bondi Beach, Sydney.","title":"SITREP - 14 DEC 25 - Bondi Shooting"},{"content":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Father Sajid Akram and son Naveed Akram were ALMOST CERTAINLY acting on behalf of Islamic State (IS) ideologies. Naveed was LIKELY originally exposed to radicalization by Isaak El Matari back in 2019. At that time, during ASIO’s investigation of Naveed, he LIKELY didn’t show any signs of radicalization and its POSSIBLE these beliefs faded. Increased Israel/Gaza tensions PROBABLY reigniting Naveed’s radicalization, which was then shared and developed in his father Sajid. It is UNLIKELY that other individuals linked to Isaak El Matari were involved, however this will ALMOST CERTAINLY be a line of investigation for police.\nFather Sajid Akram (50 years) and son Naveed Akram (24 years) have been positively identified as the two shooters involved in the Bondi Beach attack. Reports have indicated that an IS flag was recovered from the shooters vehicle. They both lived in the same residence in Bonnyrigg, and both stayed at an AirBnb in Campsie prior to the attack.\nhttps://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fe3.365dm.com%2F25%2F12%2F1600x900%2Fskynews-bondi-beach-sydney_7109804.jpg%3F20251214161242\u0026amp;f=1\u0026amp;nofb=1\u0026amp;ipt=cda2a8f90d7d31d5bb9b4080cfbd48643a6cc1e1332ea98aaf839162311a4341\nFig 1: Naveed Aktram (left) and Sajid Akram (right) during the shooting.\nSajid Akram emigrated to Australia on a student visa in 1998 where his son Naveed was born in 2001. Both father and son lived under the same roof in Bonnyrig which was investigated by police following the Bondi Shooting. Sajid Akram was the licensed gun holder, and has legally held firearms for 10 years without concern.\nOfficials stated that Naveed Akram had been under assessment for 6 months back in 2019 following Naveed’s connection to Isaak El Matari. It was reported that they were acquaintances though the strength of their connection is unknown at this time. Following this assessment period (2019/2020) it was determined that Naveed was not a threat to safety\nCOMMENT. Isaak El Matari, from Greenacres, Sydney, was arrested in 2019 following an investigation that revealed he had become radicalized by IS, and had planned to travel to Afghanistan to support IS fighters in the area. He was self proclaimed to be the commander of IS in Australia but during his trial the judge declared that Matari didn’t have “the slighted idea” how to conduct the plans he had discussed with others. It was reported that he was without weapons or followers. He was sentenced in 2021 and is still in prison. END COMMENT.\nASSESSMENT. It is PROBABLE that the son, Naveed, radicalized his father. These radical beliefs LIKELY began from contact with Isaak El Matari back in 2019, though they PROBABLY remained latent until recent international conflict reignited radical ideologies. It is ALMOST CERTAIN that Sajid and Naveed planned the attack in their Bonnyrigg residence, LIKELY no planning communications took place over phone/email/etc, drastically reducing national intelligence agencies ability to investigate further. It is UNLIKELY that other individuals connected to Isaak El Matari were involved in the planning of the attack, however this will ALMOST CERTAINLY be a line of investigation for police.\nSources Sydney Morning Herald\nABC\nSBS-1\nSBS-2\nNews.com\nProbability Indicators Probability \u0026lt; 10% \u0026lt; 25% \u0026gt; 25% \u0026gt; 50% \u0026gt; 75% \u0026gt; 90% Wording DOUBTFUL UNLIKELY POSSIBLE LIKELY PROBABLE ALMOST CERTAIN ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/sitreps/sitrep25dec15-bondishootersislinks/","summary":"OSINT analysis of Bondi Shooters IS links, reporting current at time of creation.","title":"SITREP - 15 DEC 25 - Analyzing the Bondi Shooter's Islamic State Links"},{"content":"Weekly Intelligence Digest - 20251212 A concise, structured summary of the week\u0026rsquo;s most relevant developments across security, cyber, geopolitics, organised crime and national resilience in the Pacific.\n1. (Japan/Philippines) Informal talks over Type 03 SAM sales Reporting indicates that Japan and the Philippines have held informal talks regarding the sale of Type 03 Medium Range Surface to Air missiles (Chu-SAM). Designed to engage all air platforms, the Japanese Type 03 is capable of neutralizing low flying ballistic and cruise missiles.\nCOMMENT: The addition of the Type 03 to the Filipino integrated air defense system would provide improved native defensive capabilities against Chinese rocket forces.\nANALYSIS: It is PROBABLE that Japan is interested in enhancing other South East Asian nation capabilities to deter Chinese military operations in the South China Sea. These early discussions LIKELY developed as a result of recent disputes between Japan and China and China will PROBABLY retaliate in the coming weeks. Japan developing military trade relationships with other South East Asian nations would be a strong indicator of strategic retaliation against China.\nAsia Times Missilery\n2. (Japan/China) PLA-N use active radar as China/Japan dispute continues Japan reported that PLA-N directed active radar at Japanese F-15 jets operating in the vicinity of disputed islands near Okinawa. China claims that Japan was made aware of the\u0026quot;Standard maritime activity in the area\u0026quot; and that Japan is merely fanning flames.\nANALYSIS: Military interactions will PROBABLY continue, with POSSIBLE maritime disputes resulting in coast guard/fishing boat clashes. It is LIKELY that these military run ins will continue and POSSIBLY escalate over the next 30 days. Continued military cooperation between Japan and other South East Asian Nation\u0026rsquo;s will LIKELY continue as a strategic response to China\u0026rsquo;s aggression.

(Papua New Guinea/Bougainville) Bougainville independence in \u0026lsquo;final leg\u0026rsquo; of planning by PNG Representatives from PNG and Bougainville held talks this week at Port Moresby over the future of the autonomous region of Bougainville. Following the non-binding Bougainville independence referendum in 2019, PNG declared that it would ratify the result. The process by which this would be conducted has been unclear and Bougainville locals have concerns that PNG leaders were dragging the chain full ratification. PNG however has stated that they are in the final leg in which the referendum results will go to parliament. This is anticipated for the first half of 2026. Reports indicate that PNG leaders are sensitive to setting a precedent for other parts of the country wishing to break away.\nCOMMENT: Bougainville has long sought independence from PNG dating back to the Bougainville Conflict, spanning from 1988-1998. This saw extensive fighting between PNG, Australian and Indonesia against Bougainville, Solomon islands and allegedly Fiji. This conflict was finalized by the establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government which since then has wanted to become fully independent.\nANALYSIS: The ratification of Bougainville\u0026rsquo;s independence would ALMOST CERTAINLY require extensive support from PNG and other Pacific powers to ensure ongoing government stability. China would PROBABLY leverage their positive relationship with the Solomon Islands to position themselves to engage Bougainville economically. As a newly independent nation they will ALMOST CERTAINLY be susceptible to coercion, making Bougainville a strategically valuable, and vulnerable, Pacific Island Nation.\nRNZ Bougainville Conflict\nWatch List - Next 7 Days Japanese arms agreements with other Pacific nations.
