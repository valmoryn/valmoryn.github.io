  "articleBody": "Weekly Intelligence Digest - 20251128 A concise, structured summary of the week’s most relevant developments across security, cyber, geopolitics, organised crime and national resilience.\n1. (US/JAPAN/CHINA) Military Development at Yonaguni Island Reporting indicates that since September 2025, US marines have conducted multiple logistics missions supplying the Japanese island of Yonaguni with medical supplies and disaster response equipment, including refrigeration units. This was done as part of exercise Resolute Dragon 2025. Reporting shows that Japan has announced it will be deploying the Type 03 medium-range surface to air missile launchers (Chū-SAM Kai) on Yonaguni. China has responded with firm verbal threats if Japan was to become involved in a Taiwan conflict.\nCOMMENT. The island of Yonaguni is positioned 110km to the east of Taiwan, within China’s “First Island Defense Line”. It acts as a key surveillance and anti-access hub in the East China Sea. END COMMENT\nASSESSMENT. Japan and America are ALMOST CERTAINLY positioning supplies at Yonaguni with the intention of it acting as a forward base of operations in the event of a Taiwan conflict. The presence of refrigerant indicates LIKELY blood storage, as such it will be a key medical hub/casualty evacuation center. The positioning of Japanese surface to air missiles is PROBABLY to enhance anti-access and area denial of eastern approaches to Taiwan. Chinese missile capabilities would PROBABLY overwhelm the Type 03 (Chū-SAM Kai) if Yonaguni was targeted. China will PROBABLY take retaliatory economic actions to cohere Japan and POSSIBLY conduct military drills/exercises as a show of force. It is UNLIKELY that this will result in a flash point for conflict in the Pacific.\nAsia Times\nTheJapanTimes\n2. (Pacific Nations) The Lowy Institute has released the Pacific Power Ratings for 2025 The Lowy Institute is a strategic think tank that has released the 2025 Pacific Power Ratings. The ratings are generated from detailed analysis outlining power and influence in the Pacific. Notable results from the 2025 study show that the US has marginally fallen in power, though still remaining in the top position. China has shown a noticeable increase and Russia has retaking the 5th position moving Australia to 6th. India has also positioned itself as a “Major Power” in the region.\nLowy Institute Pacific Power Ratings 2025\n3. (Tonga/China) Tonga and China confirm 9 Memorandums of Understanding Tongan King Tupou VI and President Xi Junping have wrapped up their meetings in Beijing with the reported signing of 9 memorandums of understanding. These are said to develop closer bilateral ties in terms of medical assistance, education, trade, economic development, people to people relations and green power. Reports from Reuters shows that Tonga is heavily indebted to China’s EXIm Bank, with World Bank data showing it owes Beijing $112 million, accounting for 48% of Tongas external debt. This is largly construction loans through the Belt and Road Initiative.\nAustralia has allocated $17.49 million to help boost climate change and rising sea levels, while the US committed $4.1 million in 2024.\nCOMMENT. Tonga is a small pacific island of approx. 108,000 people. Much of the Belt and Road Initiative construction work is done in part by Chinese nationals and State Owned Enterprises. END COMMENT\nASSESSMENT. China ALMOST CERTAINLY sees Tonga as a valuable ally to allow freedom of movement throughout the Pacific. The promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative in Tonga ALMOST CERTAINLY allows Chinese state owned enterprises to develop and maintain port and road infrastructure as well as conduct surveillance of the nation. It is PROBABLE that China will seek to enhance security and defense cooperation with Tonga in the coming years. This will LIKELY cause increased friction between China and Western powers.\nReuters\nMatangi Tonga\n4. (Australia/Tonga/China) Australia and Solomon Islands $190 mil policing deal delayed Reporting indicates that Australia and the Solomon islands have made little progress in the $190 million deal to grow the size and capability of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIFP) as well as build an enduring sovereign security capability. The deal was set to take place over four years however the agreement hasn’t yet been confirmed. There are reports that there are “One or two differences” preventing the memorandum of understanding from being signed.\nCOMMENT. China has established a Solomon Islands Police Training Force that has provided hands on training to RSIFP members both within the Solomon Islands and Fujian Police Collage in China. END COMMENT\nASSESSMENT. It is LIKELY that the Solomon Islands Government is hesitant to sign an agreement that would strain continued cooperation with China, particularly on matters of police training and infrastructure projects. China would PROBABLY coerce the Solomon Islands into maintaining their close security ties by using financial motivators. Solomon Islands LIKELY wants to adjust the proposed Australian policing deal to be less committal and allow continued support from both countries.\nABC News\nWatch List - Next 7 Days Yonaguni Island developments, particularly around Chinese Economic responses to Japan.

Reports from Reuters shows that Tonga is heavily indebted to China&rsquo;s EXIm Bank, with World Bank data showing it owes Beijing $112 million, accounting for 48% of Tongas external debt. This is largly construction loans through the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>Australia has allocated $17.49 million to help boost climate change and rising sea levels, while the US committed $4.1 million in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENT.</strong> Tonga is a small pacific island of approx. 108,000 people. Much of the Belt and Road Initiative construction work is done in part by Chinese nationals and State Owned Enterprises. <strong>END COMMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT.</strong> China ALMOST CERTAINLY sees Tonga as a valuable ally to allow freedom of movement throughout the Pacific. The promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative in Tonga ALMOST CERTAINLY allows Chinese state owned enterprises to develop and maintain port and road infrastructure as well as conduct surveillance of the nation. It is PROBABLE that China will seek to enhance security and defense cooperation with Tonga in the coming years. This will LIKELY cause increased friction between China and Western powers.</p>

<h2 id="4-australiatongachina-australia-and-solomon-islands-190-mil-policing-deal-delayed">4. (Australia/Tonga/China) Australia and Solomon Islands $190 mil policing deal delayed<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-australiatongachina-australia-and-solomon-islands-190-mil-policing-deal-delayed">#</a></h2>
<p>Reporting indicates that Australia and the Solomon islands have made little progress in the $190 million deal to grow the size and capability of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIFP) as well as build an enduring sovereign security capability. The deal was set to take place over four years however the agreement hasn&rsquo;t yet been confirmed. There are reports that there are &ldquo;One or two differences&rdquo; preventing the memorandum of understanding from being signed.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENT.</strong> China has established a Solomon Islands Police Training Force that has provided hands on training to RSIFP members both within the Solomon Islands and Fujian Police Collage in China. <strong>END COMMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT.</strong> It is LIKELY that the Solomon Islands Government is hesitant to sign an agreement that would strain continued cooperation with China, particularly on matters of police training and infrastructure projects. China would PROBABLY coerce the Solomon Islands into maintaining their close security ties by using financial motivators. Solomon Islands LIKELY wants to adjust the proposed Australian policing deal to be less committal and allow continued support from both countries.</p>
