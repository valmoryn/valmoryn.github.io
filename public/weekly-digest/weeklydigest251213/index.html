(Japan/Philippines) Informal talks over Type 03 SAM sales Reporting indicates that Japan and the Philippines have held informal talks regarding the sale of Type 03 Medium Range Surface to Air missiles (Chu-SAM). Designed to engage all air platforms, the Japanese Type 03 is capable of neutralizing low flying ballistic and cruise missiles.\nCOMMENT: The addition of the Type 03 to the Filipino integrated air defense system would provide improved native defensive capabilities against Chinese rocket forces.\nANALYSIS: It is PROBABLE that Japan is interested in enhancing other South East Asian nation capabilities to deter Chinese military operations in the South China Sea. These early discussions LIKELY developed as a result of recent disputes between Japan and China and China will PROBABLY retaliate in the coming weeks. Japan developing military trade relationships with other South East Asian nations would be a strong indicator of strategic retaliation against China.\nAsia Times Missilery\n2. (Japan/China) PLA-N use active radar as China/Japan dispute continues Japan reported that PLA-N directed active radar at Japanese F-15 jets operating in the vicinity of disputed islands near Okinawa. China claims that Japan was made aware of the\"Standard maritime activity in the area\" and that Japan is merely fanning flames.\nANALYSIS: Military interactions will PROBABLY continue, with POSSIBLE maritime disputes resulting in coast guard/fishing boat clashes. It is LIKELY that these military run ins will continue and POSSIBLY escalate over the next 30 days. Continued military cooperation between Japan and other South East Asian Nation’s will LIKELY continue as a strategic response to China’s aggression. China will PROBABLY respond with increase maritime incursions and military signalling.\nNY Times\n3. (Papua New Guinea/Bougainville) Bougainville independence in ‘final leg’ of planning by PNG Representatives from PNG and Bougainville held talks this week at Port Moresby over the future of the autonomous region of Bougainville. Following the non-binding Bougainville independence referendum in 2019, PNG declared that it would ratify the result. The process by which this would be conducted has been unclear and Bougainville locals have concerns that PNG leaders were dragging the chain full ratification. PNG however has stated that they are in the final leg in which the referendum results will go to parliament. This is anticipated for the first half of 2026. Reports indicate that PNG leaders are sensitive to setting a precedent for other parts of the country wishing to break away.\nCOMMENT: Bougainville has long sought independence from PNG dating back to the Bougainville Conflict, spanning from 1988-1998. This saw extensive fighting between PNG, Australian and Indonesia against Bougainville, Solomon islands and allegedly Fiji. This conflict was finalized by the establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government which since then has wanted to become fully independent.\nANALYSIS: The ratification of Bougainville’s independence would ALMOST CERTAINLY require extensive support from PNG and other Pacific powers to ensure ongoing government stability. China would PROBABLY leverage their positive relationship with the Solomon Islands to position themselves to engage Bougainville economically. As a newly independent nation they will ALMOST CERTAINLY be susceptible to coercion, making Bougainville a strategically valuable, and vulnerable, Pacific Island Nation.\nRNZ Bougainville Conflict\nWatch List - Next 7 Days Japanese arms agreements with other Pacific nations.

<p>Representatives from PNG and Bougainville held talks this week at Port Moresby over the future of the autonomous region of Bougainville. Following the non-binding Bougainville independence referendum in 2019, PNG declared that it would ratify the result.

<p>COMMENT: Bougainville has long sought independence from PNG dating back to the Bougainville Conflict, spanning from 1988-1998. This saw extensive fighting between PNG, Australian and Indonesia against Bougainville, Solomon islands and allegedly Fiji.

<p>ANALYSIS: The ratification of Bougainville&rsquo;s independence would ALMOST CERTAINLY require extensive support from PNG and other Pacific powers to ensure ongoing government stability. China would PROBABLY leverage their positive relationship with the Solomon Islands to position themselves to engage Bougainville economically. As a newly independent nation they will ALMOST CERTAINLY be susceptible to coercion, making Bougainville a strategically valuable, and vulnerable, Pacific Island Nation.</p>
