Naveed was LIKELY originally exposed to radicalization by Isaak El Matari back in 2019. At that time, during ASIO’s investigation of Naveed, he LIKELY didn’t show any signs of radicalization and its POSSIBLE these beliefs faded. Increased Israel/Gaza tensions PROBABLY reigniting Naveed’s radicalization, which was then shared and developed in his father Sajid. It is UNLIKELY that other individuals linked to Isaak El Matari were involved, however this will ALMOST CERTAINLY be a line of investigation for police.\nFather Sajid Akram (50 years) and son Naveed Akram (24 years) have been positively identified as the two shooters involved in the Bondi Beach attack. Reports have indicated that an IS flag was recovered from the shooters vehicle. They both lived in the same residence in Bonnyrigg, and both stayed at an AirBnb in Campsie prior to the attack.\nhttps://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fe3.365dm.com%2F25%2F12%2F1600x900%2Fskynews-bondi-beach-sydney_7109804.jpg%3F20251214161242\u0026f=1\u0026nofb=1\u0026ipt=cda2a8f90d7d31d5bb9b4080cfbd48643a6cc1e1332ea98aaf839162311a4341\nFig 1: Naveed Aktram (left) and Sajid Akram (right) during the shooting.\nSajid Akram emigrated to Australia on a student visa in 1998 where his son Naveed was born in 2001. Both father and son lived under the same roof in Bonnyrig which was investigated by police following the Bondi Shooting. Sajid Akram was the licensed gun holder, and has legally held firearms for 10 years without concern.\nOfficials stated that Naveed Akram had been under assessment for 6 months back in 2019 following Naveed’s connection to Isaak El Matari. It was reported that they were acquaintances though the strength of their connection is unknown at this time. Following this assessment period (2019/2020) it was determined that Naveed was not a threat to safety\nCOMMENT. Isaak El Matari, from Greenacres, Sydney, was arrested in 2019 following an investigation that revealed he had become radicalized by IS, and had planned to travel to Afghanistan to support IS fighters in the area. He was self proclaimed to be the commander of IS in Australia but during his trial the judge declared that Matari didn’t have “the slighted idea” how to conduct the plans he had discussed with others. It was reported that he was without weapons or followers. He was sentenced in 2021 and is still in prison. END COMMENT.\nASSESSMENT. It is PROBABLE that the son, Naveed, radicalized his father. These radical beliefs LIKELY began from contact with Isaak El Matari back in 2019, though they PROBABLY remained latent until recent international conflict reignited radical ideologies. It is ALMOST CERTAIN that Sajid and Naveed planned the attack in their Bonnyrigg residence, LIKELY no planning communications took place over phone/email/etc, drastically reducing national intelligence agencies ability to investigate further. It is UNLIKELY that other individuals connected to Isaak El Matari were involved in the planning of the attack, however this will ALMOST CERTAINLY be a line of investigation for police.\nSources Sydney Morning Herald\nABC\nSBS-1\nSBS-2\nNews.com\nProbability Indicators Probability \u003c 10% \u003c 25% \u003e 25% \u003e 50% \u003e 75% \u003e 90% Wording DOUBTFUL UNLIKELY POSSIBLE LIKELY PROBABLE ALMOST CERTAIN ",
